#Node Test Template
This project is a basic starting point for a node project supporting ES6, code linting, and unit tests.  

- Using ES6 is optional.  Transpiling is setup to use babelify  The build process will support it though.
- Unit tests are setup for use with Mocha, Chai, Sinon
- 

## NPM Script Descriptions

- ```npm start```  will build your project into the dist directory and then run it
- ```npm run dev``` will run test, build the project, and run the code watcher and nodemon

## Prerequisites
- This project requires NodeJS and GIT.  
  - [Node](https://nodejs.org) uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.   
  - [Git](https://git-scm.com) is a free and open source distributed version control system.  Git should natively be installed on your mac.
- All other dependencies are installed via [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) during the Getting Started instructions

## Getting Started
1. Clone the git repository ```git clone```
